# rookit userland

*This project is in the development phase, functions that this userland rootkit will have, hide directory, hide port 1337 so netstat does not detect it, reverse connection backdoor. syscalls that will be intercepted: write, fopen, readdir. That's it for now, I'll update it over time.*
