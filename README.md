# rookit userland

* Welcome to my rootkit user, some cool and interesting functions it will do, when the digital attacker: kill 1337 it will ask for a password if the password matches it will perform the next step, if the password is not the same the machine will shut down , ok, but what happens if the password is the same? The rootkit will hide port 1337, that is, netstat (in the future I think I'll add it to ss) so it will hide port 1337, and in addition it will run a bind shell on the local machine, yes the firewall can block it, so I'm going to do a choose for the user to want a reverse shell or bind shell, the tail command will have no effect, that is, the sysadmin will not see his suspicious logs and will not use another tool to check the logs, but in the future I think about, for the sysadmin Don't be suspicious, I will hide /etc/ld.so.preload.*
